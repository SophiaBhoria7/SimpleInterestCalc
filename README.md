# Simple Interest Calculator
This is a simple program where the Principle, Rate, and Time values are collected from the user to give them an output of their Simple Interest. Language: Java

Developed a program using the formula for SI where P = Principle, R = Rate, T = Time, and SI = Simple Interest:

SI = (P * R * T) / 100 

The values of P, R, and T are all taken from the user and used in the calculation where the Simple Interest output is printed out to the user.
